## ðŸ”´ Use of Github ðŸ”´

We used github to collaborate and create this project in multiple ways:

* 1âƒ£ **Collaboration with Pull Requests and Issues:** We were a team of three members. Therefore, we created detailed **Pull Requests** to collaborate over this project. Moreover, all the bugs/features were dealt using **Issues**. We also requested **Reviews** on the PRs so that the changes could not break the product.

* 2âƒ£ **Collaboration with Project:** Recently, we came accross Github Projects. For this hack, we utilized Github Projects to keep a track of each one's progress. We created different sections: ToDo, In Progress, Under Review, Finished and Video for the perfect team collaboration. You can check our Project [here](https://github.com/users/savi-1311/projects/3). The complete process was automated and on attaching the Project to the PRs, they were transferred to the ToDo column.

* 3âƒ£ **Branch Usage:** Since we had two products, a chrome extension as well as a website, we initially thought of creating two repostories. But smartly using branches, helped us store our code without using two repos. The extension is stored on the ```master``` branch and the website is on the ```website``` branch. After using the branches, it was quite easy for us to create PRs.

* 4âƒ£ **Github Pages:** Our Website is deployed at https://savi-1311.github.io/Slazy/ using Github pages. It was very simple to set up and host the ```website``` branch.

* 5âƒ£ **Github Wiki:** We also utilized the Github Wiki to explain how to setup the project locally. You can check the wiki [here]().

* 6âƒ£ **Github Workflows:** As a bonus, we also utilized Github workflows to assign labels to the PR to make the repository more readable.

* 7âƒ£ **Github Templates:** The Pull Requests and Issues already have a template. Just try to raise an issue, you will be prompted to choose between two options: Feature/Bug. The templates are created using yaml file. Apart from that, we have also added MIT License and the ReadMe file.
